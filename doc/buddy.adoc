Project Maturity
----------------

Since _buddy_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


Install
-------

This section covers installing _buddy_.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_buddy_ has support for these jvm versions:

- JDK7
- JDK8


Leiningen
~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to use _buddy_ in a Clojure project is by including
it as a dependency in your *_project.clj_*:

._in project.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
[buddy "0.2.3"]
----

Maven
~~~~~

Also, you can use it with maven. First, add the clojars repository:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>clojars.org</id>
    <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
----

Then for buddy:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>buddy</groupId>
    <artifactId>buddy</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.3</version>
</dependency>
----


Get the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_buddy_ is opensource and is entirely developed on link:https://github.com/niwibe/buddy[github].

You can clone the public repository with this command:

[source,text]
----
git clone https://github.com/niwibe/buddy

Common Web Security
-------------------

Generic Message Signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "signing framework" of _buddy_ is mainly based on django's
link:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/signing/[Cryptographic
signing] library but extended with various signing algorithms and cryptography
support.

It can be used for several purposes:

- Safety send/store signed or encrypted messages.
- Safely storing session data in cookies instead of a database (It prevents others from changing session content)
- Self contained token generation for use it on completely stateless token based authentication.

NOTE: this library is used by one of authentication backends for implement token based stateless authentication.

.Supported Algorithms
[options="header"]
|=====================================================================================
|Algorithm name     | Hash algorithms   | Keywords           | Priv/Pub Key?
|Elliptic Curve DSA | sha256, sha512    | `:es256`, `:es512` | Yes
|RSASSA PSS         | sha256, sha512    | `:ps256`, `:ps512` | Yes
|RSASSA PKCS1 v1_5  | sha256, sha512    | `:rs256`, `:rs256` | Yes
|HMAC               | sha256*, sha512   | `:hs256`, `:hs256` | No
|=====================================================================================

+++*+++ indicates the default value.


[NOTE]
====
Only HMAC based algorithm supports plain text secret keys, If you want use
Digital Signature instead of hmac, you must have a key pair (public and private).
====


Using low level api
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are four signing functions in *`buddy.sign.generic`* namespace: `sign`,
`unsign`, `loads` and `dumps`.

`sign` and `unsign` are low level and work primarily with strings.

.Unsigning previously signed data
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.sign.generic :refer [sign unsign]])

;; Sign data
(def signed-data (sign "mystring" "my-secret-key"))

;; signed-data should contain a string similar to:
;; "mystring:f08dd937a438f43639d34a345910148cb933ea8ea0c2c306e8733e0255677e3d:MTM..."

;; Unsign previosly signed data
(def unsigned-data (unsign signed-data "my-secret-key"))

;; unsigned-data should contain the original string: "mystring"
----

The signing process consists of appending signatures to the original
string and separating the signature with a predefined separator (default
":" char).

Each signature has a timestamp attached (with millisecond of accuracy) so you can
invalidate signed messages based on their age.

.Invalidate signed data using timestamp
[source,clojure]
----
;; Unsign with max-age (15min)
(def unsigned-data (unsign signed-data "my-secret-key" {:max-age (* 15 60)}))

;; unsigned-data should contain a nil value if the signing date is
;; older than 15 min.
----


Protecting complex data structures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to protect a native data structure (hash-map, hash-set,
list, vector, etc...)  you can do so using the signing `dumps` and
`loads` functions.

They accept the same parameters as their low level friends, but can also sign
more complex data.

.Sign/Unsign Clojure hash-map
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.sign.generic :refer [dumps loads]])

;; Sign data
(def signed-data (dumps {:userid 1} "my-secret-key"))

;; signed-data should contain a string similar to:
;; "TlBZARlgGwAAAAIOAAAABnVzZXJpZCsAAAAAAAAAAQ:59d9e8063ad80f6abd3092b45857810b10f5..."

;; Unsign previously signed data
(def unsigned-data (loads signed-data "my-secret-key"))

;; unsigned-data should contain a original map: {:userid 1}
----

NOTE: it uses a Clojure serialization library link:https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy[Nippy]


Using Digital Signature algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For use anyone of digital signature algorithms you must have a private/public key. If you
don't have one, don't worry - it's very easy to generate one using *openssl*.


Elliptic Curve DSA
++++++++++++++++++

[source, bash]
----
# Generating params file
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -out ecparams.pem

# Generate a private key from params file
openssl ecparam -in ecparams.pem -genkey -noout -out ecprivkey.pem

# Generate a public key from private key
openssl ec -in ecprivkey.pem -pubout -out ecpubkey.pem
----


RSA based signatures
++++++++++++++++++++

[source, bash]
----
# Generate aes256 encrypted private key
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out privkey.pem 2048

# Generate public key from previously created private key.
openssl rsa -pubout -in privkey.pem -out pubkey.pem
----


Using Digital Signature Keys for signing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now, having generated a key pair, you can sign your messages with the
previously mentioned Digital Signature algorithms.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.sign.generic :refer [sign unsign]])

;; Import namespace for managing/reading keys
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])

;; Create keys instances
(def ec-privkey (keys/private-key "ecprivkey.pem"))
(def ec-pubkey (keys/public-key "ecpubkey.pem"))

;; Use them like plain secret password with hmac algorithms for sign
(def signed-data (sign "mystring" ec-privkey {:alg :ec256}))

;; And unsign
(def unsigned-data (unsign signed-data ec-pubkey {:alg :ec256}))
----

Json Web Signature/Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~*New in version:* 0.2~

JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital
signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) based data structures.

List of rfcs related to this feature:

- http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-20
- http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms-26
- http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-26


.Supported Algorithms
[options="header"]
|=====================================================================================
|Algorithm name     | Hash algorithms   | Keywords           | Priv/Pub Key?
|Elliptic Curve DSA | sha256, sha512    | `:es256`, `:es512` | Yes
|RSASSA PSS         | sha256, sha512    | `:ps256`, `:ps512` | Yes
|RSASSA PKCS1 v1_5  | sha256, sha512    | `:rs256`, `:rs256` | Yes
|HMAC               | sha256*, sha512   | `:hs256`, `:hs256` | No
|=====================================================================================

NOTE: almost all specified algorithms in jws-algorithms rfc are implemented. Add
support for missing algorithms is very easy to add possibly them will be added in
the near future (pull-requests welcome).


Signing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the nature of storing format, the input is restricted mainly to json objects
on the current version.

.Example sign data using JWS
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.sign.jws :as jws])

;; Sign data using default `:hs256` algorithm that does not
;; requres special priv/pub key.
(def data (jws/sign {:userid 1} "secret"))

;; data should contain string similar to:
;; "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1MiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyaWQiOjF9.zjenOuIAEG-..."

(jws/unsign data "secret")
;; => {:userid 1}
----


Password Hashers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another important part of a good authentication/authorization library
is providing some facilities for generating secure passwords.

_buddy_ comes with a few functions for generating and verifying
passwords such as the widely used password derivation algorithms:
bcrypt and pbkdf2.

.Supported password hashers algorithms
[options="header"]
|=====================================================================================
| Hash algorithm name  | Namespace              | Observations
| Bcrypt               | `buddy.hashers.bcrypt` | Recommended
| Pbkdf2               | `buddy.hashers.pbkdf2` | Recommended
| Scrypt               | `buddy.hashers.scrypt` | Recommended
| sha256               | `buddy.hashers.sha256` | Not recommended
| md5                  | `buddy.hashers.md5`    | Broken! Not Recommended
|=====================================================================================


The hashers  consist in two functions: `make-password` and `check-password`.

The purpose of these functions is obvious: creating a new password,
and verifying incoming plain text password with previously created
hash.

.Example of creating and verifying a new hash
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.hashers.bcrypt :as hs])

(def myhash (hs/make-password "secretpassword"))
(def ok (hs/check-password "secretpassword" myhash))

;; ok var reference should contain true
----

[NOTE]
====
`make-password` accepts distinct parameters depending on hasher implementation and all functions
work with strings instead of bytes (unlike cryptographic hash functions).
====


Authentication for Ring & Compojure
-----------------------------------

Additionally, buddy commes with web library support for authentication
and authorization. It mainly works with ring (and compojure, since it
is ring-based) but in the future it can be extended for work with
other libraries.


Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Buddy differs with other libraries because it takes very different approach for handling
authentication. In first step, it clearly split authentication and authorization in two
separated steps and in second step, implements it using "backends" and protocols for easy
extensibility.

If you are not happy with builtin backends, you can implement your own and use it with
buddy middlewares without any problem.

Authentication in buddy, has two phases:

- Parse: parsing incoming request headers, parameters etc...
- Authenticate: having parsed data do authentication process, such as call auth function,
  unsign self contained token, etc...

.Here is a list of built-in authentication backends:
[options="header"]
|=====================================================================================
| Backend name | Namespace                       | Observations
| Http Basic   | `buddy.auth.backends.httpbasic` |
| Session      | `buddy.auth.backends.session`   | Can be combined with password hashers.
| Token        | `buddy.auth.backends.token`     | Can be combined with password hashers and high level signing library for generate tokens.
| SignedToken  | `buddy.auth.backends.token`     | Based on the high level signing framework.
|=====================================================================================


HTTP Basic
^^^^^^^^^^

The HTTP Basic authentication backend is one of the simplest and most insecure authentication
systems, but is a good first step for understand how buddy authentication works.

.Simple ring handler/view for example purpose.
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth :refer (authenticated?)])
(require '[ring.util.response :refer (response)])

;; Simple ring handler. This can also be a compojure router handler
;; or anything else compatible with ring middlewares.
(defn handler
  [request]
  (if (authenticated? request)
    (response (format "Hello %s" (:identity request)))
    (response "Hello Anonymous")))
----

.Create an instance of authentication backend.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth.backends.httpbasic :refer [http-basic-backend]])

;; Http Basic backend in this case requires one function with parameter
;; that takes a responsability to identify the incoming request.

;; The required function is caled in authentication of parsed data
;; and it receives the current ring request and parsed data from parse
;; phase of authentication.
;;
;; This function should return a non-nil value that
;; is automatically stored on :identity key on request
;; If it returns nil, a request is considered unauthenticated.

(defn my-authfn
  [request, authdata]
  (let [username (:username authdata)
        password (:password authdata)]
    username))

(def backend (http-basic-backend {:realm "MyApi" :authfn my-authfn}))
----


Now having simple view function and backend defined, you should wrap it
in a standard ring middleware way with buddy's authentication middleware.

.Declare auth function and create ring app with wrapped handler.
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth.middleware :refer [wrap-authentication]])

;; Define the main handler with *app* name wrapping it
;; with authentication middleware using an instance of
;; just created http-basic backend.

;; Define app var with handler wrapped with buddy's authentication
;; middleware using just previously defined backend.

(def app (wrap-authentication handler backend))
----

Now, all incoming request with basic auth header are properly parsed and
request with `:identity` forwarded to real handler or next middleware.


Session
^^^^^^^

The session backend has the simplest implementation because it relies
entirely on ring session support.

It checks the `:identity` key on session to authenticate the user with its
value. The value is identified as logged user if it contains any logical true
value.

See xref:examples[examples section] for complete examples for this backend.


Token
^^^^^

Standard
++++++++

This backend works much like the basic auth backend with the difference that this works with
tokens that can be unpredictable.

It parses a token and passes it to _authfn_ for authentication.


Signed/Stateless
++++++++++++++++

This backend is very similar to standard token backend previously explained, but instead
of relying on _authfn_ for identify a token, it uses stateless tokens (contains all needed
data in a token, without storing any information about token on database as ex...).

This backend relies on the security of the high level signing framework for user authentication.

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_buddy_ also comes with an authorization system.

The authorization system is split into two parts:

- access rules system, using rules and logical combinators that applies to specific urls (matching
  them using regular expressions) or specific handlers wrapping with the `restricted` decorator.
- generic authorization system using exceptions for fast return and unauthorized-handler function
  for handle unauthorized requsts.


Access Rules System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Introduction
++++++++++++

The access rules are another part of the authorization system, and consist of a list of rules
for one or more uri's using regular expressions. One rule consists of a regular expression with its
associated handler (function) with authorization logic.

.Simple rule definition example.
[source,clojure]
----
{:pattern #"^/admin/.*"
 :handler admin-access}
----

Function with authorization logic has the following appearance:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth :refer (authenticated?)])

(defn should-be-authenticated
  [request]
  (authenticated? request))

(defn should-be-safe
  [request]
  (let [method (:method request)]
    (if (or (= method :get) (= method :head))
      true
      false)))
----

It should return a boolean value with true when request is authorized and false
for unauthorized.

Also, you can combine multiple rules using logical operators in an other rule:

[source,clojure]
----
{:pattern #"^/admin/.*"
 :handler {:or [should-be-authenticated
                should-be-safe]}}
----

You can nesting rules combinators as you want:

[source,clojure]
----
{:pattern #"^/admin/.*"
 :handler {:or [should-be-admin
                {:and [should-be-safe
                       should-be-authenticated]}]}}
----


Usage
+++++

Now, knowing how rules can be defined, the question is, How can we use
it for access control for routes?

In this case you have two ways:

- Define a separated vector of handlers and pass it to authorization middleware
- Use more granular `restricted` decorator/middleware for specific functions.


For wrap separated defined access rules, you should use `wrap-access-rules`
buddy middleware. Here some examples of how to setup authorization for you ring
app:

.Define a list of rules
[source,clojure]
----
;; Rules handlers used on this example are omited for code clarity
;; and them repsents a authorization logic for its name.

(def rules [{:pattern #"^/admin/.*"
             :handler {:or [admin-access operator-access]}}
            {:pattern #"^/login$"
             :handler any-access}
            {:pattern #"^/.*"
             :handler authenticated-access}])
----

.Define default behavior for not authorized requests
[source,clojure]
----
;; This functions works like default ring compatible handler
;; and should implement the default behavior for request
;; that are not authorized by any defined rule

(defn reject-handler
  [request]
  {:status 403
   :headers {}
   :body "Not authorized"})
----

.Wrap your handler with access rules (and run with jetty as example)
[source,clojure]
----
(defn -main
  [& args]
  (let [options {:rules rules :reject-handler reject-handler}
        app     (wrap-access-rules your-app-handler options)]
    (run-jetty app {:port 9090}))
----

NOTE: An unauthorized exception is raised if no reject handler is
specified. These exceptions can be captured by generic authorization
middleware.

NOTE: If request uri not match any regular expression, the default policy enter in
action. Default policy in buddy is *allow* but you can change the default behavior
specifiec `:reject` value to `:policy` option.


If you don't want a external rules list and simple want apply some rules to specific
ring views/handlers, your can use `restrict` decorator/middleware:


.Simple example using compojure routes.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth.accessrules :refer [restrict]])

(defn home-controller
  [request]
  {:body "Hello World" :status 200})


(defroutes app
  (GET "/" [] (restrict home-controller {:rule should-be-authenticated
                                         :reject-handler reject-handler}))
----


Generic authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An other way to handle not authorized exceptions is using exceptions. It is less functional
but in some sircumstances can work very well.

But how it works? It is very simple, the authorization backend wraps everything in
a try/catch block watching only specific exception, and in case of unauthorized exception
is intercepted, executes a specific function for handle it or reraise the exception.

With this approach you can define your own middlewared/decorators with custom authorization
logic with fast skip raising not authorized exception using `throw-unauthorized` function.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth :refer [authenticated? throw-unauthorized]])
(require '[ring.util.response :refer (response redirect)])

(defn home-controller
  [request]
  (when (not (authenticated? request))
    (throw-unauthorized {:message "Not authorized"}))
  (response "Hello World"))
----

Like authentication system, authorization is also implemented using protocols. Taking advantage of
it, all built-in authentication backends also implements this authorization protocol (`IAuthorization`):

[NOTE]
====
Some authentication backends require specific behavior in the authorization layer (like http-basic
which should return `WWW-Authenticate` header when request is unauthorized). By default, all backends
come with an specific implementation.

You can overwrite the default behavior by passing your own exception handler through the
`:unauthorized-handler` keyword parameter in the backend constructor.
====

Below is a complete example setting up a basic/generic authorization
system for your ring compatible web application:

.Define the final handler
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.auth.backends.httpbasic :refer [http-basic-backend]])
(require '[buddy.auth.middleware :refer [wrap-authentication wrap-authorization]])

;; Define the final handler wrapping it on authentication and
;; authorization handler using the same backend and overwriting
;; the default unathorized request behavior with own, previously
;; defined function

(def app
  (let [backend (http-basic-backend
                 {:realm "API"
                  :authfn my-auth-fn
                  :unauthorized-handler my-unauthorized-handler})]
    (-> handler
        (wrap-authentication backend)
        (wrap-authorization backend))))
----

NOTE: If you want know how it really works, see xref:how-it-works[How it works] section or
take a look on examples.


Cryptographic Api
-----------------

Buddy has a low-level interface and a high-level interface.

The low-level interface is located in the `buddy.core` namespace and
has implementations for:

- cryptographic hash algorithms
- key derivation algorithms
- digital signatures
- message authentication (mac)
- cryptographic algorithms (block & stream ciphers)


Cryptographic hash algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All hash algorithms are located in the `buddy.core.hash` namespace.

.Available hash algorithms
[options="header"]
|===============================================
| Hash algorithm name  | Digest size
| SHA1                 | 160
| SHA2                 | 256, 384, 512
| SHA3                 | 256, 384, 512
| MD5                  | 128
| Tiger                | 192
|===============================================


Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

.Import namespace example:
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.hash :as hash])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])
----

.Usage examples:
[source, clojure]
----
(hash/sha256 "foo bar")
;; -> #<byte[] [B@162a657e>

(-> (hash/sha256 "foo bar")
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "fbc1a9f858ea9e177916964bd88c3d37b91a1e84412765e29950777f265c4b75"
----


Advanced usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hash functions are implemented using protocols and can be extended
to other types. The default implementations come with support
for file-like objects (*File*, *URL*, URI* and *InputStream*).

.Make hash of file example:
[source, clojure]
----
;; Additional import for easy open files
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(-> (hash/sha256 (io/input-stream "/tmp/some-file"))
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "bba878639499c8449f69efbfc699413eebfaf41d4b7a7faa560bfaf7e93a43dd"
----

You can extend it for your own types using the
*buddy.core.hash/Digest* protocol:

[source,clojure]
----
(defprotocol Digest
  (make-digest [data algorithm]))
----

[NOTE]
Functions like *sha256* are aliases for the more generic
function *digest*.


Mac algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Buddy comes with three mac implementations: *HMac*, *SHMac* and *Poly1305*.

HMac & SHMac
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two variants of hmac: simple and salted. And are available
in the `buddy.core.mac.hmac` and `buddy.core.mac.shmac` respectively.

Basic usage
+++++++++++

[source, clojure]
----
;; Import required namespaces
(require '[buddy.core.mac.hmac :as hmac])
(require '[buddy.core.mac.shmac :as shmac])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])

;; Generate sha256 hmac over string
(-> (hmac/hmac "foo bar" "mysecretkey" :sha256)
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "61849448bdbb67b39d609471eead667e65b0d1b9e01b1c3bf7aa56b83e9c8083"

;; Same example but using salted variant
(-> (shmac/shmac "foo bar" "salt" "mysecretkey" :sha256)
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "bd5f7a0040430a73f4845bac8f980c6398b4baae8a22efcc22038be0f4dd9678"
----

The key parameter can be any type that implements the *ByteArray* protocol
defined in the `buddy.core.codecs` namespace. It comes with default implementations for
`byte[]` and `java.lang.String`.


Advanced usage
++++++++++++++

Like hash functions, hmac is implemented using Clojure
protocols and comes with default implementations for: String, byte[],
*File*, *URL*, *URI* and *InputStream*.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

;; Generate hmac for file
(-> (io/input-stream "/tmp/somefile")
    (hmac/hmac "mysecretkey" :sha256)
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "4cb793e600848da2053238003fce4c010233c49df3e6a04119b4287eb464c27e"
----

You can extend it for your own types using `buddy.core.mac.hmac/HMac` protocol:

[source,clojure]
----
(defprotocol HMac
  (make-hmac [data key algorithm]))
----


Poly1305
^^^^^^^^

Poly1305 is a cryptographic message authentication code
(MAC) written by Daniel J. Bernstein. It can be used to verify the
data integrity and the authenticity of a message.

The security of Poly1305 is very close to the block cipher algorithm.
As a result, the only way for an attacker to break Poly1305 is to break
the cipher.

Poly1305 offers cipher replaceability. If anything goes wrong with
one, it can be substituted by another with identical security
guarantees.

Unlike *HMac*, it requires an initialization vector (IV). An IV is
like a salt. It should be generated using a strong random number
generator for security guarantees. Also, the IV should be of the same
length as the chosen cipher block size.


Basic usage
+++++++++++

The default specification talks about AES as default block cipher,
but buddy comes with support for three block ciphers: AES, Serpent
and Twofish.

.Make mac using Serpent block cipher with random IV
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer [bytes->hex]])
(require '[buddy.core.mac.poly1305 :as poly])
(require '[buddy.core.keys :refer [make-random-bytes]])

(let [iv  (make-random-bytes 16)
      mac (poly/poly1305 "some-data" "mysecret" iv :serpent)]
  (println (bytes->hex mac)))
;; => "1976b1c490c306e7304a59dfacee4207"
----


Public/Private keypairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before explaining digital signatures, you need to read public/private
keypairs and convert them to usable objects. Buddy has limited support
for reading:

- RSA keypair
- ECDSA keypair


RSA Keypair
^^^^^^^^^^^

An RSA keypair is obviously used for RSA encryption/decryption, but it
is also used for making digital signatures with RSA-derived
algorithms.

.Read keys
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])

;; The last parameter is optional and is only mandatory
;; if a private key is encrypted.
(def privkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.3des.rsa.pem" "secret")
(def pubkey (keys/public-key "test/_files/pubkey.3des.rsa.pem"))
----

.Generate a RSA Keypair using openssl.
[source,bash]
----
# Generate AES-256 encrypted private key
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out privkey.pem 2048

# Generate public key from previously created private key.
openssl rsa -pubout -in privkey.pem -out pubkey.pem
----


ECDSA Keypair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like RSA keypairs, ECDSA is also used for making digital signatures
and can be read like in the RSA examples.

.Read keys.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])

;; The last parameter is optional and is only mandatory
;; if a private key is encrypted.
(def privkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.ecdsa.pem" "secret")
(def pubkey (keys/public-key "test/_files/pubkey.ecdsa.pem"))
----

.Generate a ECDSA Keypair using openssl.
[source, bash]
----
# Generate a params file
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -out ecparams.pem

# Generate a private key from params file
openssl ecparam -in ecparams.pem -genkey -noout -out ecprivkey.pem

# Generate a public key from private key
openssl ec -in ecprivkey.pem -pubout -out ecpubkey.pem
----


Digital Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Digital Signatures differ from Mac as Mac values are both generated
and verified using the same secret key. Digital Signatures require a
public/private keypair. It signs using a private key and verifies a
signature using a public key.


RSASSA PSS
^^^^^^^^^^

RSASSA-PSS is an improved probabilistic signature scheme with
appendix. What that means is that you can use a private RSA key
to sign data in combination with some random input.

link:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt[rfc3447.txt]

.Sign sample string using rsassa-pss.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])
(require '[buddy.core.sign.rsapss :as rsapss])

;; Read private key
(def rsaprivkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.3des.rsa.pem" "secret"))

;; Make signature
(def signature (rsapss/rsapss "foo" rsaprivkey :sha256))

;; Now signature contains a byte[] with signature of "foo" string
----

.Verify signature using rsassa-pss.
[source, clojure]
----
;; Read private key
(def rsapubkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/pubkey.3des.rsa.pem"))

;; Make verification
(rsapss/verify "foo" signature rsapubkey :sha256))
;; => true
----


RSASSA PKCS1 v1.5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RSASSA-PSS is an probabilistic signature scheme with appendix.
What that means is that you can use a private RSA key to sign data.

link:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt[rfc3447.txt]


.Sign sample string using rsassa-pkcs.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])
(require '[buddy.core.sign.rsapkcs :as rsapkcs])

(def rsapubkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/pubkey.3des.rsa.pem"))

;; Make verification
(rsapkcs/verify "foo" signature rsapubkey :sha256))
;; => true
----


Eliptic Curve DSA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a variant of the
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curve cryptography.

.Sign sample string using ecdsa.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])
(require '[buddy.core.sign.ecdsa :as ecdsa])

;; Read private key
(def ecdsaprivkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.ecdsa.pem" "secret"))

;; Make signature
(def signature (ecdsa/ecdsa "foo" ecdsaprivkey :sha256))
----

.Verify signature using ecdsa.
[source, clojure]
----
;; Read private key
(def ecdsapubkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/pubkey.ecdsa.pem"))

;; Make verification
(ecdsa/verify "foo" signature ecdsapubkey :sha256))
;; => true
----


Key Derivation Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key derivation functions are often used in conjunction with non-secret parameters
to derive one or more keys from a common secret value.

*buddy* commes with several of them:

.Supported key derivation functions.
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================
|Algorithm name | Constructor              | Notes
|HKDF           | `buddy.core.kdf/hkdf`    | HMAC based KDF

[NOTE]
====
All key derivation functions work with byte arrays. For the
following examples, the functions in `buddy.core.codecs` convert
strings to byte arrays.
====


HKDF
^^^^

HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is implemented according to IETF RFC 5869

.Example using hkdf
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])
(require '[buddy.core.kdf :as kdf])

;; Using hkdf derivation functions. It requires a
;; key, salt and optionally info field that can
;; contain any random data.

(let [kfn (kdf/hkdf (str->bytes "mysecretkey")
                    (str->bytes "mypublicsalt")
                    nil ;; info parameter can be nil
                    :sha256)]
  (-> (kdf/generate-bytes! kfn 8)
      (bytes->hex)))
;; => "0faba553152fce4f"

----

KDF1/2
^^^^^^

KDF1/2 hash-based key derivation functions for derived keys and ivs as defined by IEEE P1363a/ISO 18033.

.Example using kdf1 or kdf2
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])
(require '[buddy.core.kdf :as kdf])

;; kdf1 and kdf2 are very similar and have the same
;; constructor signature. Requires: key data, salt
;; and hash algorithm keyword.

(let [kfn (kdf/kdf2 (str->bytes "mysecretkey") (str->bytes "mypublicsalt") :sha256)]
  (-> (kdf/generate-bytes! kfn 8)
      (bytes->hex)))
;; => "0faba553152fce4f"
----


Counter Mode KDF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hash-based KDF with counter mode defined by the publicly available NIST SP 800-108 specification.


Feedback Mode KDF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hash-based KDF with feedback mode defined by the publicly available NIST SP 800-108 specification.


Double-Pipeline Iteration Mode KDF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hash-based KDF with Double-Pipeline Iteration Mode defined by the publicly available
NIST SP 800-108 specification.


Ciphers
~~~~~~~

Ciphers support in buddy is available on `buddy.core.crypto` namespace.

Block Ciphers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits,
called blocks, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key.

.This is a list of currently supported block ciphers in buddy
[options="header"]
|========================================
|Algorithm name     | Keywords
| Twofish           | `:twofish`
|========================================

Additionally, for good security, is mandatory to combine a block cipher with some cipher
mode of operation.

.This is a list of currently supported of cipher mode of operation
[options="header"]
|========================================
|Algorithm name     | Keywords
| SIC (CTR)         | `:ctr`, `:sic`
| CBC               | `:cbc`
| OFB               | `:ofb`
|========================================

Encrypt data using buddy's crypto primitives is almost easy. In case of block ciphers, you
should know that block cipher and cipher mode you want to use.

NOTE: currently buddy comes with limited number of ciphers and modes, but in near future
should be added much more options.

.Example encrypt
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.crypto :as c])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])

(let [eng   (c/engine :twofish :cbc)
      iv16  (make-random-bytes 16)
      key32 (make-random-bytes 32)
      data  (hex->bytes "000000000000000000000000000000AA")]
  (c/initialize! eng {:key key32 :iv iv16 :op :encrypt})
  (c/process-block! eng data))
;; => #<byte[] [B@efadff9>
----


Stream Ciphers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stream ciphers differes with block ciphers, that them works with arbitrary length input
and not requires any additional mode of operation.

.This is a list of currently supported of stream ciphers in buddy
[options="header"]
|========================================
|Algorithm name     | Keywords
| ChaCha           | `:chacha`
|========================================


.Example encrypt
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.crypto :as c])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])

(let [eng   (c/stream-engine :chacha)
      iv8   (make-random-bytes 8)
      key32 (make-random-bytes 32)
      data  (hex->bytes "0011")]
  (c/initialize! eng {:key key32 :iv iv8 :op :encrypt})
  (c/process-bytes! eng data))
;; => #<byte[] [B@efadff9>
----

NOTE: the iv and key size depends estrictly on cipher engine, in this case, chacha
engine requires 8 bytes iv.

NOTE: for decrypt, only change `:op` value to `:decrypt`

You can call `c/initialize` any times as you want, it simple reinitialize the engine.


Codecs
~~~~~~

Implements some useful and widely used around all buddy library functions
for converting between strings, bytes, hex encoded strings and base64
encoded strings.

The best documentation for this part is the source code.


Advanced Usage
--------------

[[how-it-works]]
How Auth Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each backend implements two protocols: `IAuthentication` and `IAuthorization`.

*IAuthentication* provides two functions: `parse` and `authenticate`
and is automatically handled with `wrap-authentication` ring
middleware. This is an example flow for the http basic backend:

1. Received request is passed to `parse` function. This function extracts the +Authorization+
   header, decodes a base64 encoded string and returns Clojure map with `:username` and `:password`
   keys. If a parse error occured, it returns nil.
2. If the previous step parsed the token successfully, `authenticate` is called with current
   request and parsed data from previous step. `authenticate` can delegate authentication
   to user defined function passed as `:authfn` parameter to backend constructor.
   `authenticate` should return a request with `:identity` key assigned to nil or any other
   value. All requests with `:identity` key with nil value are considered not authenticated.
3. User handler is called.


[NOTE]
=========================
- `parse` function can return valid response, in that case response is returned inmediatel
  ignoring user handler.
- if `parse` function returns nil, `authenticate` function is ignored and user handler is
  called directly.
- `authenticate` also can return a valid response, in these case it has same behavior that
  with `parse` function.
=========================

*IAuthorization* provides `handle-unauthorized` function. Each backend implements it default
behavior but it can be overwritted with user defined function, passed on `:handle-unauthorized`
keyword parameter to backend constructor. It always should return a valid response.

Authorization is handled automatically with `wrap-authorization` ring middleware. It wraps
all request in try/catch block for intercept only authorization exception.

This is a flow that follows authorization middleware:

1. User handler is wrapped in try/catch block and executed.
2. Not authorized exception is raised with `buddy.auth/throw-unauthorized` function from
   any part of your handler.
3. handle-unauthorized is executed of your backend, if user has specified it own function,
   the user defined function is executed else, default behavior is executed.


Examples
--------

_buddy_ comes with some examples for helping a new user understand how
it works. All examples are available in the `examples/` directory.

At the moment, two examples are available:

- link:https://github.com/niwibe/buddy/tree/master/examples/sessionexample[Use session backend as authentication and authorization.]
- link:https://github.com/niwibe/buddy/tree/master/examples/oauthexample[Use session backend with oauth2 using Github api.]


To run examples, you should be in the project's root directory.
Execute `lein with-profile examplename run` where examplename can be
`sessionexample` or `oauthexample`.

FAQ
---

*Buddy is a security library/framework?*

Yes and No. I don't like call "security" library because security represents a very generic
concepts and can contain a lot of things. Buddy is target to cryptography, message signing
and authentication/authorization extensions for ring compatible web applications. You can see
the main target on the "Introduction" section of this documentation.

*How can I use _buddy_ with link:http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/[liberator]?*

By design, _buddy_ has authorization and authentication well
separated. This helps a lot if you want use only one part of it (ex:
authentication only) without including the other.

The best combination is to use _buddy_'s authentication middleware
with liberator authorization endpoints.

*Buddy has own cryptographic algorithms implementations?*

Mainly no, I'm not cryptography expert and I rely this to battle tested Bouncy Castle java
library dedicated to that.

*Buddy will support pgp?*

Surely not! Because there is already exists one good link:https://github.com/greglook/clj-pgp[library for that].

How to Contribute?
------------------

Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _buddy_ should keep these important rules in mind.


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

_buddy_ unlike Clojure and other Clojure contrib libs, does not have many
restrictions for contributions. Just follow the following steps depending on the
situation:

**Bugfix**:

- Fork the GitHub repo.
- Fix a bug/typo on a new branch.
- Make a pull-request to master.

**New feature**:

- Open new issue with the new feature proposal.
